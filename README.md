# php-stub-generator
A tool to generate stub-files for your php classes.

The main purpose for this tool is to generate stub-files from php classes to have code 
completion for your IDE when encrypting your library with e.g. 
[the ioncube encoder](http://www.ioncube.com/php_encoder.php).

## Installation

A basic installation via Composer could be done this way:

```bash
composer require setasign/php-stub-generator
```

Composer will install the tool to your project's `vendor/setasign/php-stub-generator` directory.


## Basic usage

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

use setasign\PhpStubGenerator\PhpStubGenerator;
use setasign\PhpStubGenerator\Reader\AllFiles;

require_once __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';

$generator = new PhpStubGenerator();
$generator->addSource(
    'setapdf-core',
    new AllFiles(__DIR__ . '/vendor/setasign/setapdf-core/library')
);
$output = $generator->generate();

file_put_contents(__DIR__ . '/setapdf-core-stub.php', $output);
```

Alternatively you could just call the cli helper.

```bash
vendor/bin/php-stub-generator generate setapdf-core/library setapdf-core-stub.php
```

## Settings
The PhpStubGenerator class has following settings:
```php
class PhpStubGenerator
{
    /**
     * End of line character(s).
     *
     * Doesn't change the used EOL character(s) of doc blocks.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public static $eol = "\n";

    /**
     * Tab character(s)
     *
     * @var string
     */
    public static $tab = '    ';

    /**
     * If enabled all generated class constants get a visibility (the generated stubs require PHP >= 7.1)
     * 
     * Within the cli tool can be set with the option "--addClassConstantsVisibility"
     * 
     * @var bool
     */
    public static $addClassConstantsVisibility = false;
    
    /**
     * If false the interface \Stringable won't be filtered out (the generated stubs require PHP >= 8.0).
     *
     * Within the cli tool can be set with the option "--includeStringable"
     *
     * @var bool
     */
    public static bool $includeStringable = false;
}
```

## Drawbacks
- Calculated constants or constants that use other constants like \_\_DIR\_\_ will be filled with the values of the 
  runtime environment.
- Global Functions and Constants are currently ignored
